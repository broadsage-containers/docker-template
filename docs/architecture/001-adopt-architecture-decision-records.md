# ADR-001: Adopt Architecture Decision Records

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Broadsage Containers project is establishing itself as a community-driven, upstream-focused container project under Broadsage's open source initiative. As we make significant architectural decisions during this project development, we need a way to document and track these decisions for current and future contributors.

This initiative represents Broadsage's commitment to open source innovation in the container ecosystem, fostering community collaboration while maintaining transparency in decision-making processes.

Without proper documentation of architectural decisions:

- New contributors struggle to understand why certain choices were made
- Important context behind decisions is lost over time  
- Similar discussions happen repeatedly
- The project lacks transparency in its decision-making process

## Decision

We will adopt Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) using the format proposed by Michael Nygard. Each significant architectural decision will be documented as a separate ADR file in the `docs/architecture/` directory.

ADRs will include:

- Clear title describing the decision
- Status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
- Context explaining why the decision was needed
- The actual decision made
- Consequences both positive and negative

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- Architectural decisions are documented and searchable
- New contributors can understand the reasoning behind current architecture
- Decision-making process becomes transparent
- Reduces repeated discussions about settled decisions
- Creates valuable historical context for the project

### Negative Consequences

- Additional overhead for documenting decisions
- Requires discipline to maintain ADRs consistently
- May slow down decision-making process initially

### Neutral Consequences

- Establishes a standard format for architectural documentation
- Creates a new responsibility for maintainers

## Notes

- This ADR establishes the framework for all future architectural decisions
- ADRs should be created for any decision that significantly affects the project's architecture, development process, or user experience
- The ADR process will be reviewed after 6 months to assess its effectiveness
