## Overview

This is an enterprise-grade, security-hardened NGINX container built as part of Broadsage's open source container initiative. It provides a production-ready nginx implementation with comprehensive security hardening, designed for mission-critical deployments and regulated environments.

**Key Features:**

- üîí **Security-Hardened**: Comprehensive security hardening with minimal attack surface
- ‚ö° **Performance-Optimized**: Tuned for high-performance production workloads
- üõ°Ô∏è **Enterprise-Grade**: Suitable for regulated industries and high-security environments
- üîÑ **CVE-Responsive**: Rapid security updates and vulnerability management
- üìä **Transparency**: Complete SBOM and vulnerability reporting
- üèóÔ∏è **Production-Ready**: Battle-tested for mission-critical deployments

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run with default configuration
docker run --name nginx -p 80:80 ghcr.io/broadsage/nginx:1.29

# Health check
curl http://localhost/health
# Response: healthy
```

### Custom Configuration

```bash
# Mount custom nginx configuration
docker run --name nginx -p 80:80 \
  -v /path/to/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro \
  ghcr.io/broadsage/nginx:1.29

# Mount custom site configuration
docker run --name nginx -p 80:80 \
  -v /path/to/site.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro \
  ghcr.io/broadsage/nginx:1.29

# Mount custom content
docker run --name nginx -p 80:80 \
  -v /path/to/html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro \
  ghcr.io/broadsage/nginx:1.29
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  nginx:
    image: ghcr.io/broadsage/nginx:1.29
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro
      - ./ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl:ro
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
```

## Architecture & Design

This container is built with enterprise-grade security and performance as the primary design goals:

### Security Hardening

- **Non-root execution**: Runs as nginx user (UID 101) with minimal privileges
- **Minimal attack surface**: No SUID binaries, minimal packages, hardened base image
- **Security headers**: Comprehensive security headers (X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- **Log isolation**: Logs forwarded to stdout/stderr for secure log aggregation
- **File system hardening**: Read-only root filesystem support, minimal writable areas

### Enterprise Features

- **Standard ports**: HTTP (80), HTTPS (443) for enterprise network compatibility
- **Configuration flexibility**: Standard nginx file layout for easy integration
- **Health monitoring**: Built-in health checks and monitoring endpoints
- **Signal handling**: Graceful shutdown and reload for zero-downtime deployments
- **Resource optimization**: Tuned for production workload performance

### Performance Optimizations

- **Worker tuning**: Auto-configured based on available CPU cores and memory
- **Connection handling**: Optimized for high-concurrency enterprise scenarios
- **Compression**: Advanced gzip and brotli compression for bandwidth efficiency
- **Caching**: Intelligent static file serving with proper cache headers

## Configuration

### Default Configuration Structure

```bash
/etc/nginx/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nginx.conf              # Main configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ conf.d/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ default.conf        # Default server block
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ssl/                    # SSL certificates (if mounted)

/var/log/nginx/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ access.log -> /dev/stdout
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ error.log -> /dev/stderr

/usr/share/nginx/html/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html              # Default welcome page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 404.html               # Custom 404 page
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 50x.html               # Server error page
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NGINX_WORKER_PROCESSES` | `auto` | Number of worker processes |
| `NGINX_WORKER_CONNECTIONS` | `1024` | Max connections per worker |
| `NGINX_KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT` | `65` | Keep-alive timeout in seconds |

### Health Check Endpoint

The container includes a built-in health check endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost/health
# Returns: healthy
```

## Development & Testing
