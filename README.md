project:
  name: "my-nginx"
  description: "Custom NGINX container with security hardening"
maintainer:
  name: "Your Name"
  email: "you@example.com"
```

### 2. Generate Your Project

Using Docker:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace ghcr.io/broadsage/docker-template
```

```bash
podman run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace ghcr.io/broadsage/docker-template
