# Broadsage Open Source Containers - Governance Model

This document outlines the governance structure and decision-making processes for the Broadsage Open Source Containers project. Our governance model is designed to foster open collaboration while ensuring technical excellence, security standards, and sustainable project growth.

## Mission Statement

The Broadsage Open Source Containers project provides enterprise-grade, security-hardened container images for popular applications through transparent, community-driven development. We aim to create production-ready alternatives to commercial hardened container solutions while maintaining full transparency and community control.

## Core Principles

### üåê Open & Transparent

- All architectural decisions documented via ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Public development process with transparent roadmaps
- Open discussion of technical and governance issues
- Regular community updates and progress reports

### üîí Security-First

- Security considerations prioritized in all decisions
- Rapid response to vulnerabilities across all container images
- Comprehensive security hardening and testing
- Transparent security posture documentation

### ü§ù Community-Driven

- Inclusive decision-making process
- Merit-based contributions welcome from all backgrounds
- Diverse maintainer team representing different perspectives
- Community input actively sought for major decisions

### ‚ö° Enterprise-Ready

- Production-quality standards for all releases
- Comprehensive testing and validation processes
- Professional documentation and support materials
- Compatibility with enterprise deployment patterns
