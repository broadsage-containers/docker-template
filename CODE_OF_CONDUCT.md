# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

[![Code of Conduct](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code%20of%20Conduct-2.1-4baaaa.svg?style=flat)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
- Showing appreciation for contributors and maintainers
- Using welcoming and inclusive language in all communications
- Being patient with newcomers and those learning

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Community Guidelines

In addition to following this Code of Conduct, we encourage all community members to:

- **Be constructive**: Provide helpful feedback and suggestions
- **Be respectful**: Treat all community members with courtesy and respect
- **Be collaborative**: Work together to solve problems and build solutions
- **Be inclusive**: Welcome newcomers and help them get involved
- **Be professional**: Maintain a professional demeanor in all interactions
- **Stay on topic**: Keep discussions relevant to the project and community goals

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[conduct@broadsage.com](mailto:conduct@broadsage.com).
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### Reporting Process

When reporting an incident, please include:

- A detailed description of the incident
- Any relevant context or background information
- Names of individuals involved (if comfortable sharing)
- Any supporting evidence (screenshots, links, etc.)

Reports can be made:

- Via email to [conduct@broadsage.com](mailto:conduct@broadsage.com)
- Through private messages to project maintainers
- For urgent matters requiring immediate attention, contact multiple maintainers

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Initial Response**: We will provide an initial response within 7 days
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve most issues within 30 days

### Confidentiality

All reports will be handled with strict confidentiality. Information will only be shared with those who need to know to investigate and resolve the issue.

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you may appeal the decision by contacting the project maintainers at [conduct@broadsage.com](mailto:conduct@broadsage.com) with a concise description of your grievance. Appeals will be handled by individuals who were not involved in the original incident or decision.

## No Retaliation

Retaliation against individuals who report violations, provide information during an investigation, or otherwise participate in good faith in any process related to this Code of Conduct is strictly prohibited and may result in additional consequences.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
